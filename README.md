## **Introduction**

The Good News Aggregator is a web application that scrapes news articles from various news websites that specifically publish news that is considered good/positive/uplifting. With much of the world focusing on negative storylines, this application aims to remind us of the great things happening in the world every day.

## **Learning Objectives**

The goal of this project was to apply what I had learned from CS50x to develop a web application, scrape news articles from various websites, display content dynamically, and manage a SQLite database.
